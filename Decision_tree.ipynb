    "Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm and How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the feature that best separates the classes. The splitting process continues until the subsets are pure (contain only one class) or until a predefined stopping criterion is met. Each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, and each leaf node represents the class label."

    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm aims to find the feature and threshold that best separates the classes at each node. This separation is done by minimizing impurity, typically measured by metrics like Gini impurity or entropy. At each step, the algorithm selects the feature and threshold that maximize the information gain or minimize impurity."

    "Using Decision Tree Classifier for Binary Classification Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification problem, the decision tree classifier recursively splits the dataset into two subsets based on the feature and threshold that best separate the two classes. The splitting process continues until the subsets are pure or until a stopping criterion is met. Each leaf node then represents one of the two classes.\n",
    "Geometric Intuition behind Decision Tree Classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, decision tree classification can be visualized as dividing the feature space into regions, each corresponding to a class label. The decision boundaries are orthogonal to the feature axes and are determined by the feature values and thresholds selected at each node. Predictions are made by traversing the tree from the root to a leaf node based on the feature values of the input sample."
